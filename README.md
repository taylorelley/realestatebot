Based on the given task, we need to create multiple classes and functions to interact with the realestate.co.nz API, store the data, and analyze it. Here are the main classes and functions we'll need:

1. `APIHandler`: This class will be responsible for interacting with the realestate.co.nz API. It will include methods to set up the connection, handle authentication, and make requests to the API.

2. `DatabaseHandler`: This class will be responsible for storing the data retrieved from the API. It will include methods to connect to the database, create tables, insert data, and retrieve data.

3. `PropertyAnalyzer`: This class will be responsible for analyzing the data stored in the database. It will include methods to calculate the average price of properties in the same area and identify properties that are undervalued.

4. `main.py`: This will be the entry point of our program. It will create instances of the above classes and use them to pull data from the API, store it in the database, and analyze it.
